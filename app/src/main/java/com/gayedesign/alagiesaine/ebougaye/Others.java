Whether the definition is correct or not, what is certain is that our behaviour leaves much to be desired. If the definition is tenable, one can courageously say that we are not civilized, or we are not more civilized than past generations as many of believe.

                    "<br>" +
                    "Many Africans viewed colonialists as encroachers and oppressors during the colonial era, and thus craved and clamoured for independence. However, their hopes were shattered after the attainment of independence. Despondent as they are, they ask the question “Are we really independent?” To them, “independent” Africa is much more difficult than re-independent Africa. I concur with them to a large extent because things have been growing from bad to worse and continue to deteriorate by the second since independence, as substantiated by the political, economic and social crises we are currently experiencing in Africa.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Civil wars are very common in Africa where many countries have been destabilized, with large numbers of people displaced. There is political repression and suppression, as evidenced by the persecution of politicians, writers and journalists in the form of harassment, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, incarceration, banishment and assassination. Today, most African countries are suffering from economic slump, as exemplified by the depreciation of local currencies, exorbitantly high level of inflation, heavy debt to the point of insolvency, low salaries and high rates of unemployment and brain drain. Misappropriation of public funds, arm robbery, drug peddling, arms trafficking, prostitution and baby dumping are rampant and on the rise in Africa. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "The question arises now: Who is responsible for this adverse situation? To me, a large proportion of the blame goes to our leaders whose avarice and desire for self-aggrandizement prompt them to oppress their people as a way of defending their selfish interest. That many African leaders amass wealth rapidly and lead flamboyant lifestyles amply demonstrates their immense contribution to our woes. To add insult to injury, they unscrupulously and ruthlessly maltreat their people in their selfish attempts to perpetuate themselves in power. In some cases, the money looted by African leaders can go quite a long way in servicing the debt of their countries, which leads many to wonder whether they are sincere and justified in their requests for debt relief. In other cases, the money wasted in propaganda or in trying to repair the battered image of heads of state can assuage the problems of their people or improve their wretched living conditions significantly. For these reasons, many people believe that such leaders lack mercy and are thus insensitive to the sufferings of their compatriots. This behaviour is utterly unfair and unacceptable. What is more shameful and sinful than mistreating people for self-interest after seeking their mandate to lead them and taking the oath to serve them without fear or favour, affection or ill-will? Why take loans or seek debt relief while spending lavishly? Why impose a heavy debt burden on people and deny them the chance to benefit from the money?<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "However, we should remember that a leader is just one person among many and hence cannot hold a whole country to ransom without the complicity of others, no matter what powers he has or is believed to have. I quite agree with the philosopher who contends that leaders are shaped by their societies and that members of society have their share of the blame where leaders go wrong. According to this philosopher, all leaders- good or bad- have their twin brothers or twin sisters in society. Simply put, there is affinity or inherent resemblance between leaders and some members of society- every leader has people like him in his society. This argument is cogent, for leaders come from society, not from the sky. A leader cannot do anything without the help of others, nor can he lead or become a leader without the help of people. Therefore, the blame cannot be laid squarely on the feet of African leaders for their misbehavior and our predicament. Going by this philosophy, it can be rightly stated that Africans, like their leaders, have their share of the blame for their plight. Put in simple terms, some subjects are tarred with the same brush as their leaders. Like their leaders, many Africans aspire after prestige and material resources to the extent of conniving or conspiring with bad leaders in their misdeeds.  This explains why some people in Africa put the interest of their heads of state before the interest of the masses. This is why some shameless, wicked people in Africa are always ready to do the dirty job or try to defend, justify or cover up any nonsense, regardless of the sufferings of the populace. It is for this reason that some Africans lead a life of sycophancy. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Africa has gone to the dog owing to this bad behaviour of her sons and daughters, which begets affliction for the common people. Africans have been impoverished, pauperized, agonized and antagonized by their own compatriots who hold them hostage. Independence is an era in which Africans are enslaved and brutalized by their fellow Africans, which is heartbreaking, to say the least. We have experienced deterioration in terms of living conditions and suffered human rights abuse miserably and excruciatingly at the hands of our compatriots after having been ill-treated by our colonial masters in many ways for quite a long time. Evidently, we are not really independent as envisaged and desired.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "To reverse or remedy this unfavourable situation and prove to our colonial masters that we can decide or shape our own destiny, we need to put collective or national interest before personal interest and treat each other with mercy, justice and fairness. Otherwise, we will continue to blame our colonial masters and other outsiders for our numerous crises while, at the same time, begging them and seeking protection or salvation from them continuously.</font><br>" +

                    "The decision to change the name of the OAU (Organization of African Unity) to AU (African Union) sparked a heated debate. Opinions were divided among observers as to whether the move was necessary. Cons argued that it was more important for the African leaders to demonstrate goodwill in addressing the problems bedevilling the African continent such as maladministration and lack of respect for democracy, human rights and rule of law than to change the name of the organization. Pros countered by contending that changing the name was a sign of goodwill on the part of our leaders as the motive behind it, they claimed, was to give the organization a wider scope and a greater mandate so as to render it more efficient and effective. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "My position at the time was to give our leaders the benefit of the doubt on the issue rather than condemning the move outright. I expressed this vantage point in an article I wrote in the Daily Observer newspaper of The Gambia. However, I am now inclined to believe that our leaders have failed to prove sceptics wrong, as they have not yet succeeded in resolving the African crises, numerous as they are. This lends credence to the belief held by many observers- my humble self included- that the change of name can be likened to putting old wine in a new bottle. Simply put, we are of the view that there is very little difference- if at all any- between the OAU and the AU in terms of achievement or living up to expectations.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Once again, our leaders have gathered to discuss issues affecting our continent- Africa. Many observers question the importance and rationality of the lavish gatherings of our political leaders arguing that they fail to remedy the situation or address the main problems plaguing the masses and that many Africans continue to suffer miserably from crises caused mainly by the very ones who claim to serve their interest as their leaders. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "We yearned for independence but our independence has totally deceived its purpose on account of the bad behaviour of our leaders who are insensitive to the sufferings of the masses and care more for themselves and their immediate family members than other citizens. With the exception of few, our leaders are more interested in prolonging their stay in power, accumulating wealth and living flamboyant lifestyles than seeing Africa get rid of its crises and develop rapidly as the chatterboxes and blabbermouths among them always claim, calling their critics unpatriotic citizens and puppets of the West. Ironically, Africa continues to rely heavily on its colonial masters and other donors for its development needs for over 50 years after independence, with many of its citizens seeking refuge or trying to secure citizenship for their loved ones in the West- including those who blame all our woes on the West.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Like the OAU, the AU has proved to be unwilling and unable to address the problem of dictatorship accompanied by gross human rights violations and waste of meagre resources which plagues Africa. For this reason, observers describe the organization- aptly, I believe- as a club of dictators in which each member tries to defend the interests of the others and turns blind eyes to their misdeeds, no matter how grave such wrongs are. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Sometime after its inauguration, the AU issued a declaration claiming that it intended to crack down on coups d'état in Africa by imposing a ban on the practice. Based on the high frequency of coups in Africa as opposed to other continents and the fact that coups engender bloodletting, terror, economic crises and political instability in most cases, the move was cordially welcomed by many.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "However, one is abundantly justified in questioning whether the move was a sincere one on the part of our leaders and whether it can help remedy the situation. In a continent where many of the leaders came to power through the barrel of the gun and overstaying in power is the norm, it is sheer gullibility, credulity and naivety to believe that such a move was meant for public good. Judging by the behaviour of most African leaders and their associates, characterized by blatant plundering and squandering of our limited, direly-needed resources, coupled with flagrant violation of human rights, it is utter short-sightedness and narrow-mindedness to believe that the move can help stop the practice once and for all. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "There is every indication that the move was meant to safeguard the political interest of the incumbent leaders by guaranteeing their security and safety rather than just to ensure peace and stability for the benefit of the public as our leaders wanted to make us believe. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "If our leaders were sincere in the move, those among them who mounted power by staging coups would repent their acts and apologize to their people or be asked by their counterparts to do so. But what we have seen is the contrary. Some coup-makers continue to glorify coups by celebrating their coups lavishly and remorselessly, insisting that they had genuine reasons for toppling their predecessors, endeavouring to convince people in this regard without being challenged by their counterparts. Thus, those coup-makers can be compared to a person trying to lock the door of a dining room just after entering in order to ensure comfort and enjoyment by preventing others from entering through the same door. The fact that our leaders have imposed a ban on coups without going a step further to take measures to prevent overstaying in power also casts a big shadow of doubt on their sincerity.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "It can be cogently argued that banning coups without addressing the root cause of the problem will yield very little dividends, if any. The prevalence of coups in Africa can, to a very large extent, be ascribed to the behaviour of our leaders. The dictatorial, megalomaniacal, egocentric, sadistic, bigoted and corrupt tendency of some of our leaders is a causative factor of coups. Therefore, any action taken to crack down on coups without taking this factor into account may have very little effect or prove to be an exercise in futility. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Some African leaders labour to cling onto power at all cost. They use various means to achieve their aims, which include terrorizing the population through harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention, torture and summary executions; issuing threats to intimidate opponents; doctoring the constitutions of their countries to suit their political interests; promulgating draconian laws to gag the press, stifle dissent and suppress freedom of expression; meddling in matters appertaining to the judiciary; manipulating civil servants, parliamentarians and electoral officers; monopolizing the public media; denying citizens their rights or depriving them of basic necessities; and the like. In short, those leaders seek to obtain sweeping powers and control everything to rule with iron fists, making it extremely difficult for them to be removed from power through peaceful means. When their oppression becomes unendurable, unbearable and intolerable to the masses, they resort to violent means of extricating or liberating themselves, as a cat would do to save itself when chased to a wall over which it cannot jump. Some leaders, especially coup-makers and their associates, personalize state properties. They enrich themselves in the twinkling of an eye and lead ostentatious lifestyles, spending wastefully and excessively. This behaviour has the danger of encouraging coups. It arouses the envy or anger of others who may resort to violent, unconstitutional means to weed out those greedy, selfish people in order to enjoy themselves like them or save their compatriots from economic crises and human rights violations by freeing them from the clutches of the greedy, materially-minded, extravagantly-behaved and bloodthirsty clique.  <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Thus, any action geared towards cracking down on coups should not fall short of imposing an official term-limit and introducing strict, drastic measures to curb human rights violations and corruption. If our leaders really meant business, they would make efforts to mend the cracks on the wall rather than plastering them. Put in simple terms, they would try to address the root cause of the problem if they were sincere in their move. In so doing, they would not need to impose a ban on coups, for the situation would automatically take care of itself. No leader should be allowed to cling onto power or oppress his people continuously, for no one is indispensable or superior to others as some leaders and their sycophants want to fool people into believing. Believing in the indispensability of a leader or his superiority over others or portrayal of a leader as such is not only absurd and folly but also insulting to God's intelligence. How can you expect God the Omniscient to endow only one person in a whole country with the capability or ability to govern that country? If only one person in a country has the ability to rule, what will happen when he goes to eternity or dies? Are those portrayed as indispensable leaders immortal? Given the fact that all human beings are made of bones, blood and flesh and share the seven characteristics of living organisms and that leaders are human beings, is it reasonable for a leader to be intoxicated with power or be so arrogant to the extent of feeling superior to others or be portrayed as such? Are there superhuman leaders or leaders made of materials that are more valuable than those mentioned above, unlike their fellow human beings? Hardworking or not, patriotic or not, leaders must relinquish power peacefully or step down to pave the way for others to contribute their quota. Patriotism and indispensability cannot be used to justify overstaying in power, for anybody can claim to be patriotic and indispensable or be portrayed as such by sycophants. The desire to perpetuate oneself or overstay in power can only be interpreted as greed and selfishness. That is the fact of the matter. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Coming back to coups, I would like to state that they can be eradicated or at least minimized with the imposition of presidential term-limit. Imposing a term-limit can render coups unjustifiable. For instance, coup-makers may find it difficult to gain national and international recognition after overthrowing a democratically elected president whose tenure of office is limited to eight or ten years. Cognizant of this fact, would-be coup-makers may be deterred. Besides, aggrieved, discontented or disgruntled parties may not feel the need to fall back on violent means of removing a president from office with the knowledge that his tenure of office is ephemeral or short-lived. Additionally, having a term-limit in place can help deter oppression or disregard of the rule of law on the part of leaders, which, in turn, can help deter coups. Knowing that they have very limited or short time in office and that they may be held accountable for their misdeeds when they dismount power, leaders may avoid wronging their people and think twice before acting or making decisions while in office. In other words, having a term-limit can persuade or encourage leaders to behave well or avoid malpractice, which can earn them the respect and love of their compatriots, thereby guaranteeing their security and safety by discouraging would-be coup-makers.  <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Given the fact that the African leaders overlooked the importance of imposing a presidential term-limit when they were contemplating banning coups, we should not the least surprised that coups continue to occur in Africa despite the ban on the practice. As pointed out earlier, overstaying in power and oppression must stop if we are to succeed in banning coups.             <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "To recapitulate, I would say that our leaders must see reason and change attitude for the better, as their behaviour leaves much to be desired.

                    "<br>" +
                    "The decision taken by the ECOWAS and the AU to crack down on coups d'état in Africa by imposing a ban on the practice is an interesting development. Given the high frequency of coups in Africa as opposed to other continents and the fact that coups engender bloodletting, terror, economic crises and political instability in most cases, the move is a welcome one.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "However, one is amply justified in wondering whether the move is a sincere one on the part of our leaders and whether it can help remedy the situation. In a continent where many of the leaders came to power through the barrel of the gun and overstaying in power is the norm, it is extremely hard to believe that such a move is meant for public good. Judging by the behaviour of most African leaders and their associates, characterized by blatant plundering and squandering of exiguous, direly needed public   funds, coupled with flagrant violation of human rights in the form of victimization and brutalization of citizens for political reasons, adding insults to injury, it is sheer shortsightedness to believe that the move can help stop the practice once and for all.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "There is every indication that the move is meant to safeguard the political interest of current African leaders by guaranteeing their security and safety rather than just to ensure peace and stability for the benefit of the public as our leaders want to make us believe. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "If our leaders were sincere in the move, those among them who mounted power by staging coups would repent their acts and apologize to their people or be asked by their counterparts to do so. But what we have seen is the contrary. Some coup makers continue to glorify coups by celebrating their coups lavishly, insisting that they had genuine reasons for toppling their predecessors, endeavouring to convince people in this regard without being challenged by their counterparts. Hence, those coup makers can be likened to a person trying to lock the door of an empty dining room just after entering so as to ensure comfort and enjoyment by preventing others from entering through the same door. The fact that our leaders have imposed a ban on coups without going a step further to take measures to prevent overstaying in power also casts a big shadow of doubt on their sincerity.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "It can be cogently argued that banning coups without addressing the root cause of the problem will yield very little dividends, if any. The prevalence of coups in Africa can, to a very large extent, be ascribed to the behaviour of our leaders. The dictatorial, egotistic, egoistic, sadistic, megalomaniacal, bigoted and corrupt tendency of some of our leaders is a causative factor of coups. Therefore, any action taken to crack down on coups without taking this factor into account may have very little effect or prove to be an exercise in futility. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Some African leaders labour to cling onto power at all cost. They use various means to achieve their aims, which include terrorizing the population through harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention, torture, killings, issuing threats to intimidate opponents, doctoring the constitutions of their countries to suit their political interest, promulgating draconian laws to gag the press and suppress dissent and freedom of expression, meddling in matters appertaining to the judiciary, manipulating civil servants, parliamentarians and electoral officers, monopolizing the public media, denying citizens their dues or depriving them of basic necessities and the like. In short, those leaders seek to obtain sweeping powers and attain total control of everything to rule with iron hands, making it extremely difficult or impossible for them to be removed from power through peaceful means. When their oppression becomes unendurable to the masses, they resort to violent means of extricating themselves, as a cat would do to save itself when chased to wall over which it cannot jump. Some leaders, especially coup makers and their associates, personalize state properties. They enrich themselves in the twinkling of an eye and lead flamboyant life styles, spending thriftlessly or improvidently. This behaviour has the danger of encouraging coups. It arouses the envy or anger of others who may resort to violent, unconstitutional means to weed out those greedy, selfish people in order to enjoy themselves like them or save their compatriots from economic crises by freeing them from the clutches of the rapacious, materially-minded, extravagantly-behaved clique. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Hence, any action geared towards cracking down on coups should not fall short of imposing an official term-limit and introducing strict, drastic measures to curb human rights violations and corruption. If our leaders really meant business, they would make efforts to mend the cracks on the wall rather than plastering them. Simply put, they would try to address the root cause of the problem if they were sincere in their move. In so doing, they would not need to impose a ban on coups, for the situation would automatically take care of itself. No leader should be allowed to cling onto power or oppress his people continuously, for no one is indispensable or superior to others as some leaders and their sycophants want to fool people into believing. Believing in the indispensability of a leader or his superiority over others or portrayal of a leader as such is not only folly but also insulting to God's intelligence. How can you expect God the Omniscient to endow only one person in a whole country with the capability or ability to govern that country? If only one person in a country had the ability to rule, what would happen when he goes to eternity or dies? Are those portrayed as indispensable leaders immortal? Given the fact that all human beings are made of bones, blood and flesh and share the seven characteristics of living organisms and that leaders are human beings, is it reasonable for a leader to be intoxicated with power or be so arrogant to the extent of feeling superior to others or be portrayed as such? Are there superhuman leaders or leaders made of materials that are more valuable than those mentioned above, unlike their fellow human beings? Hardworking or not, patriotic or not, leaders must relinquish power peacefully or step down to pave the way for others to contribute their quota. Indispensability cannot be used to justify overstaying in power, for anybody can claim to be indispensable or be portrayed as such by sycophants. The desire to eternize one's stay in power can only be interpreted as greed and selfishness. That is the fact of the matter. Coming back to the main point of the discourse, I would like to expand on the matter by contending that coups can be eradicated or at least minimized with the imposition of a presidential term-limit. Imposing a term-limit can render coups unjustifiable. For instance, coup makers may find it difficult to gain national and international recognition after overthrowing a democratically elected president whose tenure of office cannot go beyond eight or ten years. Cognizant of this fact, would-be coup makers may be deterred. Besides, aggrieved, discontented or disgruntled parties may not feel the need to fall back on violent means of removing a president from office with the knowledge that his tenure of office is ephemeral. Additionally, having a term-limit in place can help deter oppression or disregard of the rule of law on the part of leaders, which, in turn, can help deter coups. Knowing fully well that they have very limited or short time in office and that they may be held accountable for their misdeeds when they dismount power, leaders may avoid wronging their people and think twice before acting or making decisions while in office. In other words, having a term-limit can scare leaders into behaving well or avoiding misbehaviour and malpractice, which can earn them the respect and love of their compatriots, thereby guaranteeing their security and safety by discouraging would-be coup makers. <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Given the fact that our leaders have overlooked the importance of imposing a presidential term-limit, we should not be surprised if coups continue to occur in Africa despite this ban on the practice. As pointed out earlier, overstaying in power and oppression should stop if we are to succeed in banning coups.            <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "To sum up, our leaders must see reason and change attitude for the better, as their behaviour leaves much to be desired. They should stop playing with our intelligence if they really intend to crack down on coups as a way of ensuring peace and stability. I urge them to try this medicine. I am confident that it will prove to be efficacious.  </font> <br>"

                    "<br>" +
                    "As media practitioners and their sympathizers observe International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, I would like to comment on the subject with a view to defending the rights of journalists and advancing the cause of press freedom.  <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Journalists suffer miserably in many parts of the world, Africa in particular. They are subjected to persecution in the form of banishment, harassment, arbitrary arrests, detention, incarceration, torture and murder by tyrannical, oppressive regimes and bigoted, unscrupulous individuals with the complicity of opportunists who behave like zombies and always manipulate the law or endorse proposed draconian laws obstructing media practitioners, or carry out irrational instructions to victimize, brutalize or liquidate members of the press. What a pity!  It is either the case that those who wage war against journalists are oblivious to the importance of the fourth estate, or that they are fully cognizant of its importance in society but have chosen to hamper journalists or violate their rights for egocentric or selfish motives. The latter case is more likely, given the fact that those who persecute or kill journalists want their good deeds to be publicized and, at the same time, want to see the bad deeds of their opponents exposed. The point is buttressed by the fact that dictatorial regimes befriend and sponsor praise-singing or pro-government media houses and journalists by giving them privileges, while discriminating against independent journalists whom they brand detractors, saboteurs and unpatriotic citizens who deserve severe punishment or death. This is exemplified by the behaviour of the Gambian leader, Yahya Jammeh, towards the press. Two journalists have been murdered under his watch, many tortured severely and one abducted without trace for too long a time, with all the cases remaining unresolved as though the victims have no right to protection and justice. That Jammeh always gets angry and fumes when such horrendous, atrocious crimes are mentioned lends credence to the widely held belief that he has hands in them. Besides, Jammeh has monopolized the state media, the Gambia Radio & Television Services (GRTS) and the pro-government newspaper, the Daily Observer, which he patronizes and uses as his mouthpieces and propaganda machines. Jammeh is on record for having publicly called journalists illegitimate sons of Africa and threatening to take drastic measures against journalists who offend him.  Private media houses have been set on fire, with the culprits going scot-free in all cases. That a sizeable number of Gambian journalists currently live in exile further demonstrates Jammeh’s hostile attitude towards journalists and his abhorrence of the concept of press freedom. <br>" +
                    "  <br>" +
                    "The importance of the press cannot be over-emphasized. It informs, educates, enlightens and entertains besides serving as a watchdog.  I would not hesitate to state that the press is indispensable with regard to the promotion of justice, democracy and respect for human rights, in the absence of which there cannot be meaningful, veritable and durable peace and development. It is a well known fact that those who bear malice against journalists and combat them do at times need their services and turn to them. Hence, the press should be viewed as a development partner, not an enemy. Suppressing press freedom means keeping people in the dark, which gives rise to rumour mongering whose accompaniments are undesirable and could be enormously detrimental.  <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "It is worthy to note that any attempt made to muzzle the press arouses suspicion and attracts negative interpretations. Hatred or fear of journalists and the desire to silence, harm or eliminate them can be interpreted as fear of being exposed and an attempt to conceal or cover one’s misdeeds. If one is sure of having a clean record or having no skeleton in his cupboard, as journalists would put, there is no need for him to try to gag the press. As the saying goes, it is he who has hidden something up that has a problem with people looking up and thus tries to prevent them from doing so. In other words, one would not care whether people look up or not if he has not hidden anything up which he wants to keep out of sight. Likewise, one would not mind journalists reporting his deeds or acts if he has not done anything wrong whose exposure can discredit him or cause embarrassment for him. People in positions of responsibility should bear in mind that their comportment and acts are of public interest and thus attract the attention of the press. They better dismount their posts or pack up and leave if they cannot behave ethically and rationally or conduct affairs as expected of them and feel that the press should spare or ignore them. My message to the enemies of the press is that attempting to silence journalists is an unattainable goal and that those who try to achieve it are comparable to an elephant struggling to pass through the eye of a needle.     <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "It is utterly illogical and unjustifiable to make attempts to muzzle the press. Media practitioners err sometimes but that should not prompt aggrieved parties to try to gag the press or harm its members. People of other occupations commit blunders without being subjected to persecution or attempts being made to impose a blanket ban on their activities. There is no career or profession in which practitioners are immune from mistakes. It is common knowledge that many people who reprimand or castigate journalists labelling them as criminals for making mistakes are more reproachable or blameworthy than the latter in that they make much more serious mistakes. If mistakes are to be used as the sole excuse for clamping down on the activities of media practitioners, those press-phobic people and press-haters should quit their jobs first on account of their goofs or wrongdoings. Like people of other professions, media practitioners have formed organizations serving to bind them together, and laid down codes of conduct which guide them in their work. Hence, journalists should be allowed to practise their profession unhindered if members of other professions are allowed to execute their duties without obstruction. Journalists have an inalienable right to practise their profession freely by virtue of the fact that they are members of society and have a stake in the running of the affairs of their countries like other citizens. Where journalists are deemed not qualified enough to practise, efforts should be made to help them to develop themselves or ameliorate their skills through training. Governments, institutions and individuals can simply counter the words of journalists with words to set records straight or prove their innocence when they are falsely accused or portrayed in a negative light. Alternatively, they can seek redress at the courts rather than resorting to violent or criminal acts when they feel offended by the press. This is much more rational and civilized than persecution and killing. Those who commit crimes against journalists should not be allowed to go unpunished. They should be tracked down and brought to book like other criminals. Earnest efforts should be made to expose or hold accountable tyrants who sponsor criminals to persecute or kill journalists. They are big cowards. They and their accomplices should bear in mind that their heinous crimes haunt them till doomsday. They will never enjoy peace of mind. No amount of cover-up or camouflage can help to free their minds. They always live in hiding, and their hearts jump to their filthy mouths when their crimes are mentioned.<br>" +
                    "However, I would like to note in haste that journalists should endeavour to dig out correct information, report with utmost objectivity and criticize constructively when things go wrong, bearing in mind that freedom of expression does not mean freedom of oppression or encroachment. Put in simple terms, they should try as much as possible to abide by their codes of conduct and adhere to the ethics of their profession. This can, to somehow, facilitate their work and minimize the dangers associated with it. </font>   <br>"

They should also take into account the indisputable fact that it is much easier to entrench a dictator than to remove him. As we all know, dictators are reluctant to relinquish power or accept change. In summary, they cannot allow smooth transfer of power. They prefer to die in power or have their countries set ablaze and burnt to ashes in case of change. True, dictators can be removed with determination. However, removing a fully-fledged dictator could be extremely difficult and time-consuming, just as untying a tightly-tied rope could prove to be a hard job. Besides, it could be disastrous, calamitous or catastrophic. It is therefore folly to help a dictator entrench himself with the belief that he can be ousted easily when the urge is felt to do so.

Does it make sense to talk about independence where a leader can make unilateral, rash, silly and sensitive decisions and declarations on behalf of his compatriots, order the kidnapping, killing or torture of innocent people, personalize or monopolize state properties and institutions and freely spend meagre state resources on misplaced priorities?  Such a shameless, senseless, merciless, remorseless and rapacious leader has no moral authority to utter or make mention of the word “independence”, let alone celebrate it. He is a menace and a disgrace to Africans in particular and the human race at large, as he has proven to be a terrorist, a sadist, a plunderer, a squanderer, a tormentor, an impostor and a charlatan. Evidently, we are not really independent as envisaged and desired.      <br>" +

                    "<br>" +
                    "The remarks made by some participants in the ongoing debate on tribalism are a cause for great concern to many Gambians and friends of The Gambia who have been following lengthy exchanges. The debate takes the form of accusations and counter-accusations of tribalism, accompanied by the use of foul, provocative language. To put it bluntly, the remarks are too dangerous, as they are derogatory, disparaging, disgusting and disturbing. I therefore consider it necessary to add my voice by giving my opinion on the issue as a way of defusing tension with the ultimate goal of safeguarding our peaceful co-existence as people of diverse tribes/ethnic groups and religions. Gambia is a very small country/community in which people are related/connected in one way or the other, know each other and have lived together in peace and harmony for so long in spite of   tribal/ethnic and religious affiliation. I can use myself as an example in this respect. I have experience of intermarriage (marrying a Mandinka woman), like many other Gambians. Besides, I have family members/close relatives (men and women) who are married to members of tribes different from ours, such as Fula, Mandinka, Jola and Manjago. Additionally, I am blessed with good, affectionate friends and confidants from various tribal/ethnic and religious backgrounds. Hence, I have the conviction that we should try as much as possible to avoid acts and utterances that have the danger of raising tribal/ethnic or religious tension and souring or jeopardizing our relationships, so that we can continue to cohabit or live together and interact peacefully and harmoniously despite our diversity. Engaging in such acts or making such utterances is just like playing with fire. As one can easily be consumed or seriously burnt if he plays with fire, one can endanger oneself or facilitate his destruction by exciting or arousing tribal/ethnic and religious sentiments. Thus, I am appealing to all participants to try to exercise self-restrain in the debate by refraining from utterances that have nullifying effects on the intimate, cordial relationships/ties we been enjoying over the years, taking into account the undeniable, irrefutable fact that the subject under discussion is an extremely sensitive one. We all know that it is part of human nature to have divergent views or different ideas, but we should not regard or treat each other as enemies based on that or other unreasonable, irrational considerations such as tribal/ethnic and religious identity. I believe we can debate, exchange ideas and iron out differences in opinion without using vulgar, inflammatory language. Our venerable prophet (may peace be upon him) has said in this regard: “A good/nice word is charity.” “Let him who believe in Allah and the Last Day (the Day of Judgment) say good/beneficial things or keep quiet.” May Allah guide and protect us! Amen!<br>" +

                    "Now, allow me to reproduce- in this connection- an article I wrote in the Daily Observer newspaper of The Gambia on 17 April 2004 and later published in Gambian online newspapers, entitled Intolerance: A Recipe for Conflicts and Sufferings: <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Intolerance can be defined as inability or lack of willingness or readiness to accept ideas, ideologies or ways of behaviour of others or refusal to co-habit, co-operate, interact or deal with people or members of a group one conceives to be different from oneself or different from the members of one’s group. <br>" +

                    "What obtains in northern Nigeria is a glaring example of religious intolerance. There, Muslims and Christians are always at daggers drawn, killing each other and vandalizing churches, mosques and other valuable properties. This is not in the interest of either of the contending parties, as both suffer casualties and material losses besides having their daily businesses hampered or interrupted, which would not happen if they co-habited in peace.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Religious intolerance can be interpreted as ignorance of the teachings of the Religious Scriptures- particularly the Muslim and Christian ones- or blatant, flagrant disregard of such teachings. Allah the Almighty has stated in the Glorious Qur’an that there is no compulsion in religion. According to the Qur’an, those who call people to God should do it with wisdom and fair exhortation- not with violence. The Holy Bible enjoins us to love our neighbours as we love ourselves. This injunction concurs with the saying of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that he who believes in Allah and the Last Day would not harm his neighbour. The venerable prophet (peace be upon him) signed peace pacts with Christians and Jews in Medina and lived with them in perfect peace. Thus, people of different faiths who live together can enjoy veritable, durable peace if they understand and follow the teachings of religion.    <br>" +

                    "The Rwandan genocide involving the Hutu and the Tutsi tribes, in which an estimated number of 800,000 people were massacred in 100 days, serves as a pertinent example of racial/tribal/ethnic intolerance. Added to this appalling holocaust is the displacement of a large number of people who suffered miserably, coupled with a very great loss of properties. The clashes between the Hutus and the Tutsis in neighbouring Burundi and the Hemas and the Lendus in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), former Zaire, also exemplify racial/tribal/ethnic intolerance. <br>" +

                    "Again, it can rightly be stated that having knowledge of the teachings of religion and practising such teachings could help prevent or avoid a tragedy of this nature and magnitude.

Logically and scientifically speaking, such a claim is preposterous and untenable, for human beings are born equal and made of the same materials, which makes it folly to hate, despise, disrespect or look down on others based on race, tribe or ethnicity.<br>" +

                    "Examples of political intolerance are plentiful in Africa where politicians on the opposite sides of the political divide are always locked in squabbles, with the members of each side defaming or demonizing the other. Owing to the insincerity, hypocrisy, selfishness and greed characterizing African politics in many cases, political intolerance impacts heavily and negatively on tribalism. In Africa, perfidious, power-hungry and blood-thirsty politicians have the nasty habit of fanning the flames of tribal sentiments for political gain. <br>" +

In Ivory Coast, discriminatory laws were passed with the sole aim of barring popular candidates from contesting in elections as a way of guaranteeing victory to less popular candidates. Chief among these is the heatedly-disputed ivoireté law according to which some Ivorians were deemed more Ivorian (bona fide) than others who were considered to be second-class citizens or foreigners, and hence have less rights than the members of the former category, thereby disenfranchised. This silly act by crooked, errant politicians split the country into two main parts for quite a long time: the northern part dominated by Muslims and controlled by the New Forces rebel group, and the southern one dominated by Christians and controlled by the government. A remarkable fact is that a very large number of the inhabitants of the northern part are from the Dioula tribe whereas the southern part is predominantly inhabited by other tribes.      <br>" +

The same thing can be said about the crisis in Burundi where Nelson Mandela’s idea of rotating presidency and having in place a president from one of the two tribes and a vice-president from the other tribe was implemented to resolve the problem but without attaining the desired degree of success. The politicians of these two countries can be said to be tarred with the same brush as their counterparts in the DRC where the president, Joseph Kabila was at one time assisted by four vice-presidents chosen from different rebel factions and different tribes/ethnic groups with a view to resolving the crisis which still fails to subside.

This created great terror and led to many deaths and destruction of properties. In the latter case, the leader of the LRA, Joseph Cone was engaged in abducting, killing and mutilating people, especially women and children. He claimed to have the intention of overthrowing the Ugandan government and rule his country by the Ten Commandments of the Holy Bible, but his acts run counter to the teachings of this holy book. Superfluous to say, the resulting confrontations between the LRA and government forces also proved to be calamitous.   <br>" +

Ivory Coast, which used to be a safe haven and attracted a huge number of migrants during the time of the late President Felix Houphet Boigny, is a clear testimony to this. What has befallen Ivory Coast can happen in any country where people change attitude from ‘tolerance’ to ‘intolerance’ as the Ivorians did. This statement is substantiated by the Qur’anic verse: “God would not change the situation of a people unless they change their attitude.” In other words, God changes the situation of a nation only when they change their attitude or behaviour. So, the citizens of a country can expect positive changes in their lives if they change attitude from bad to good. By the same token, they should not be surprised when they see negative changes in their lives if they change their behaviour from good to bad. <br>" +

Countries that are marked by intolerance and conflicts should try to change attitude for the better if they want to manoeuvre their way out of their awkward situation or troubles.

                    "<br>" +
                    "The commission set  up by President Jammeh to look into matters related to tax evasion in The Gambia (1999- 2011) has recently accomplished its mission with the submission of a controversial report, followed by arrests, detention and interrogation of those implicated- reportedly in line with the recommendations of the commissioners. It goes without saying that this swift, drastic reaction of the Gambian authorities has taken many people by surprise. While some laud President Jammeh for setting up the commission and commend the commissioners for a “job-well-done”, many interpret the exercise as witch-hunting, camouflaging the situation or diverting attention from pressing issues of national interest. Others question the competency of the commissioners and the reliability of the report.   <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Many people censure the commission, labelling it as discriminatory or biased. They allege that it has spared some big companies and businessmen- President Jammeh in particular (referred to as the biggest tax evader by some commentators), while dealing harshly with others. True or false, the manner in which the commission has treated some people strongly supports these allegations. For instance, a prominent opposition political figure (a force to reckon with) who was among the first batch of professionals summoned by the commission happened to be among the first people to be arrested or invited by the police for questioning after the report was released, despite the substantiated, convincing answers he gave at the commission leading many people to believe in his innocence. This beats the imagination of many. Whether it is coincidence or a well calculated move to discredit and neutralize the politician is anybody’s guess. Appearing before the commission, two lawyers made remarks which many people believe didn’t go down well with the commissioners. When asked by the chairperson of the commission to give suggestions on the-way-forward, one of them noted that they had been talking about how tax is collected only, and not how it is spent.  To my understanding, the lawyer was suggesting having supplementary discussions on how the money collected as tax is spent rather than limiting the discussions to tax collection. The other one observed that the taxes were too many and that they should be consolidated. It can be deduced that the lawyer was complaining of heavy taxes, suggesting reduction. It is reported that these two  lawyers have been ordered to pay very huge sums of money (the biggest sums claimed as tax arrears from those who faced the commission) in spite of the fact that many people considered them to be clean based on their seemingly-satisfactory responses during their appearance. Again, one may ask whether this is coincidence or a retaliatory measure taken by the commission to punish the legal luminaries for their critical remarks. Whatever the case may be, I totally agree with their suggestions. Given the large amounts of money spent on festivals and other misplaced priorities by our government and president, one is justified in suggesting that we discuss how the money collected as tax is spent. It is good to collect tax and use the money judiciously or wisely but unfair and wicked to milk professionals, businessmen and companies or subject decent and innocent people to humiliation or harassment in the name of tax collect only to blow the money later, leaving the masses to suffer miserably. That is taxation without representation, which is utterly uncivilized and unacceptable. Coincidence or premeditated, I believe it is unjust to punish these lawyers for expressing their opinions after inviting them to do so, no matter how critical their remarks are. The commissioners are not immune to criticism, no are their bosses. It would be a very big mistake for them to expect people to treat them as sacred cows.   <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Many observers doubt whether the profit made by three people (lawyers) during the tax period (13 years) tallies with the colossal sums of money they have been ordered to pay as tax (D6.8m, D4.7m and D2.5m- according to a media report). Assuming that this report is correct and that the “defaulters” are supposed to pay 35% of their profit as tax, we can conclude that they made a profit of D19.4m (6.8x100÷35), D13.4m (4.7x100÷35) and D7.1m (2.5x100÷35) respectively during the tax period. Considering the size of our economy, I don’t think it is possible to make such a big profit in 13 years. Anyway, I stand to be corrected.  <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "The commission has condemned the tax system and procedures of The Gambia as a whole, recommending sweeping changes. Although there may be some defects or loopholes in our tax system and procedures, I very much doubt whether the commissioners are competent enough to make such far-reaching recommendations. Judging by the training and vast experience of some of our tax experts, I am not the least convinced that the commissioners are more competent or qualified than them in their domain as implied by the “findings” and recommendations contained in the report of the commission. If we lack confidence in our tax experts, system and procedures, I believe we should hire foreign tax experts who have the capacity to make good recommendations or design a better system and more user-friendly procedures for us rather than entrusting laymen or non-experts with such a sensitive, demanding task. In as much as we should try our best to curb or minimize tax evasion, it should be borne in mind that no man-devised system or procedure can be flawless or foolproof.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "The remarks made by President Jammeh after receiving the report of the Tax Commission suggest that he was in a celebratory mood. He remarked that the “defaulters” were the very ones accusing his government of corruption, threatening them with severe punishment. He was apparently rejoicing over the fact that those he perceives to be his arch-critics have been implicated by the report, giving him the chance to punish them. It is common knowledge that President Jammeh is involved in business and that he never volunteered to appear before the commission to clear his name (leading by example) as expected of him. Putting these facts into consideration, I am inclined to believe that he has no moral right to make such remarks or react in such a way.     <br>" +
                    " <br>" +
                    "Hence, it is evident that the scepticism surrounding the Tax Commission and the allegations levelled against it and its members are not unfounded or groundless. Since our economy is tax-based, I have no objection regarding tax collection or bringing tax evaders to account. However, I unreservedly disapprove of treating taxpayers as milk cows, taxation without representation and selective justice. People shouldn’t be over-taxed or brutalized in the process of tax collection. The money collected from taxpayers should be used to provide public services for the benefit of all and sundry rather than being misappropriated, dished out to praise-singers and sycophants or spent on non-essential projects, feasts and festivals. Besides, there shouldn’t be discrimination in any shape or form regarding tax collection or penalization of defaulters. It is worth noting here that our venerable prophet (may peace be upon him) cautioned against discrimination in his saying: “What caused the generations before you to perish is that when a rich person stole he was spared, and when a poor person stole he was punished.” This Hadith teaches us that laws should be applied across the board, irrespective of the positions or status of the people concerned.  </font>  <br>"

                    "The questions arise now: Why do human beings who are endowed with mental faculty to reason and can hence distinguish between right and wrong or moral and immoral oppress each other or condone oppression despite the fact that none of them wants to be oppressed? Is it that oppressors and those who condone oppression are oblivious to the laws or rules of their countries or societies?<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Ignorance of laws or rules can be dismissed as an excuse for oppression in many cases because many oppressors and condoners of oppression feel bad, cry foul and seek redress when oppressed. If ignorance was responsible for their acts, they would not be aware when oppressed. So, ignorance maybe a contributing-factor but is not the only factor. <br>" +

                    "Oppression may result from a mistake, for no man is perfect or infallible, and to err is human. Thus, one may oppress others inadvertently or accidentally. However, oppression cannot be termed as a mistake if it recurs, for mistakes cannot always be allowed or accepted.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Egomania or egocentricity and opportunism are among the factors responsible for oppression and its condonation. Greed and the desire to defend or safeguard an interest or fulfil an ambition prompt some people to oppress others or turn blind eyes and deaf ears when others are oppressed. Such egoists and opportunists are ready to bulldoze anybody they perceive as a hindrance or treat blatant acts of oppression with indifference. However, some of them always try to portray themselves as democrats, peace-lovers and patriots, or even saints, which is quite ironical. I advise them to rethink, for the world would not last even a day if everybody behaved like them. I also put it to them that not everybody is a fool as they believe, and that he that knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool.<br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Fear is one of the factors responsible for oppression or condoning oppression. This is particularly the case with people living under a dictatorial rule. Some people oppress others to ingratiate themselves with their bosses whom they fear more that they fear God the Almighty. These people behave like zombies or marionettes. They are always willing to do the dirty job of oppression, even without receiving instructions from their bosses. They are ready to do any nasty thing they believe can help defend the interest of their bosses or please them. I advise these oppressors to think of tomorrow and bear in mind that their bosses will not be able to protect themselves in the next world, let alone protecting them or interceding with God on their behalf. It is very unwise for them to dance to the tune of their mortal bosses whose powers are limited and short-lived, or seek their pleasure to the extent of incurring the wrath of God the Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent and Immortal. If they happen to be non-believers, as the case may be, let them ponder on what will happen to them here on earth when their bosses are no longer around or when they quit their dirty jobs. Do they think that their bosses will stay in their positions forever? Have they ever thought about dismissal, retirement or falling out of favour of their bosses after doing the dirty job and becoming notorious? Can these be ruled out totally? In any case, it is safer and more prudent to treat members of the general public nicely to earn their respect and love than to do a dirty job to please one’s boss and gain notoriety. Owing to their fear of brutal dictators, some people remain silent when they see others oppressed. This is one of the aims all dictators want to achieve. Dictators try to instill fear in the hearts and minds of people so that no one would dare to challenge or rise up against them. Hence, we help them to realize their objective by condoning oppression or keeping quiet as though things are normal when others are being oppressed. For people to disentangle themselves or free themselves from the clutches of a dictator, it is imperative that they try to surmount or overcome their fear and take the bull by the horns. The following saying of our venerable prophet (peace be upon him) can be used as a guiding-principle in this regard: “Anyone who sees an evil should try to change it using his hand. If he is not able to, let him use his tongue. And if he is unable to, he can use his heart but that is the weakest (lowest) degree of faith.” Oppression is incontrovertibly evil and should not be condoned from the Islamic point of view.        <br>" +
                    "<br>" +
                    "Among the factors responsible for oppression is megalomania. Some people, by virtue of their professions, status or positions, feel too haughty or proud and hence despise others whom they term as nonentities and the riffraff of their society, especially when they find themselves in positions which they never dreamt of occupying in life. This is why it is not uncommon to hear the foolish rhetorical question “Do you know who I am?” and the scornful, malicious utterance “He will know me. I will teach him a lesson that he will never forget”. These people always want to show off to the extent of oppressing others. They believe that they can behave anyhow and go scot-free. Thus, they metamorphous into sadists who take pleasure in victimizing or brutalizing people as a way of showing their power and importance. These scoundrels are so intoxicated with power and arrogance that they would not listen to anybody and no amount of preaching can move them. They belong to the group of people who the Holy Quran says are deaf, dumb and blind. Members of this group repent only after losing their privileges or after they have started paying the price of their misdeeds. Ironically, some of them turn into preachers, making citations from the Holy Scriptures, condemning the very evil acts they used to commit without any sense of remorse, and championing virtues and values which were totally absent from their vocabulary list while they were enjoying privileges. To earn public sympathy, some resort to befriending former enemies or those they held in contempt and used to victimize or brutalize. I would like to put it to those rascals that repentance is good but repentance in despair is no repentance. This kind of repentance is tantamount to insulting God’s intelligence, to say the least. In Islam, repentance is only acceptable when it is done voluntarily in good faith, not when one is helpless or desperate and has no option or choice. It is more reasonable and acceptable to repent oppressing people when one is in a privileged position or status than when he loses that position or status and becomes despondent, for repentance in the former case is voluntary, whereas it is dictated by circumstances in the latter. Above all, it is advisable to behave like a human being and help people while enjoying certain privileges, or at least treat them with justice and fairness. In so doing, one may save oneself from danger, or earn the sympathy of the general public when in trouble or when misfortune befalls him. If, on the other hand, he misbehaves by oppressing members of the public, people may shout “good riddance!” or jubilate when he is in trouble or when he loses his privileges. No matter how hard his friends, relatives or close associates try to defend or exculpate him, they find it extremely difficult or impossible to convince the public or make people believe that he is a good person, and not to talk of convincing God the All-knowing.  <br>" +

                    "My dear reader, oppression does not pay, for it can easily backfire. Besides, no one is immune in a society where oppression prevails. Anybody can have his turn at any time. Additionally, the masses may fall back on or resort to violent means of extricating themselves when oppression becomes unendurable, which could have deleterious, undesirable effects on a country as a whole. For these reasons, Allah the Almighty has stated explicitly in the Glorious Quran that He does not like oppressors. Moreover, oppression is synonymous with cruelty or lack of mercy, and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) cautioned us against wickedness saying that Allah the Almighty would not shower His mercy on those who fail to treat their fellow human beings with mercy. Hence, oppression should not be treated with indifference. Earnest, unflinching efforts should be made to combat it. In fact, combatting oppression is a socio-religious obligation. A situation where oppression is prevalent can be likened to jungle life where there are no laws or rules to guide actions. As human beings, we should be sober and wise enough to avoid such a situation. We can achieve this by using the golden rule “Do onto others as you would like others to do onto you” and the saying of our venerable prophet (peace be upon him) “Wish for others what you wish for yourself” as guiding-principles.    <br>" +
